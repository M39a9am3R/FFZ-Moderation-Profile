# Introduction
A moderation profile made to make you a more efficient moderator. Comes with pre-set moderation reasons, varying timeout durations, a handful of in-chat buttons for translations, warning timeouts, and common languages requesting users to speak English.

At the time of publishing, there is only a English version. Which means, when using the translation button, the Google translation page will automatically translate to English. After deleting a message, it will ask users to speak English.

If you would like to offer your own translations or variations, feel free to make a pull request changing the last couple characters from EN to the initials indicating your language.
